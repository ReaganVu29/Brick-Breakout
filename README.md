# Brick Breakout
This is a game similar to atari breakout. This was my first comprehensive project using java.

## Running Locally
To run this locally, download your prefered java IDE (I used Eclipse). Use javac command to convert the Java source file into the class file. You can then use the Java command to play the game.
